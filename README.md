## Naomi Schlösser

From a structural engineer to a full stack developer! Both involve problem solving, breaking down a large problem into smaller pieces, and building something from scratch. All things I really enjoy. After almost 4 years as a structural engineer, I decided to make a switch and start the software development bootcamp with Makers.

## Skills

# Perseverance
I am always determined to finish a task or find the answer to a problem. I used to search through whole Eurocodes and reach out to people to get to the bottom of an issue.

# Organised
At my previous jobs, people generally asked me where to find certain documents as I always knew where everything was. I also like to plan ahead to meet a deadline, and not wait until the last minute.

# Team player
As a structural engineer, you often have to work on your own projects, but I have never really understood that. I always feel you are learning twice as much when you're working on a problem together, such as pairing.

# Social
I enjoy being involed in the organisation of socials, hence me being in all kinds of social commitees in the past! It's very rewarding to see people enjoying something you put together. It's also a great way to get to know your colleagues better.
